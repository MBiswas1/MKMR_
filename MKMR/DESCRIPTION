Description: A functional response variable Y is regressed on scalar variables X and Z to determine if X is a significantly associated with Y. We obtain the three 
    outputs from SITAR and the scores obtained from fpca with 95% pve and use multivariate kernel machine regression on them to get p-values using linear and 
    quadratic kernels
